<H5>Cetane number</h5>

<P>A quantity indicating the ignition properties of fuel relative to cetane as a standard.Cetane number (or CN) is an inverse function of a fuel's ignition delay, the time period between the start of ignition and the first identifiable pressure increase during combustion of the fuel. In a particular diesel engine, higher cetane fuels will have shorter ignition delay periods than lower Cetane fuels.</p>

<H5>Styrene butadiene rubber</h5>



<P>Styrene-butadiene or styrene-butadiene rubber describe families of synthetic rubbers derived from styrene and butadiene. These materials have good abrasion resistance and good aging stability when protected by additives.About 50% of car tires are made from various types of SBR. The styrene/butadiene ratio influences the properties of the polymer: with high styrene content, the rubbers are harder and less rubbery.</p>

<H5>Octane number</h5>
<P>A figure indicating the anti-knock properties of a fuel, based on a comparison with a mixture of isooctane and heptane.An octane rating, or octane number, is a standard measure of the performance of an engine or aviation gasoline. The higher the octane number, the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating (igniting). In broad terms, fuels with a higher octane rating are used in high-performance gasoline engines that require higher compression ratios. In contrast, fuels with lower octane numbers (but higher cetane numbers) are ideal for diesel engines, because diesel engines (also referred to as compression-ignition engines) do not compress the fuel, but rather compress only air and then inject fuel into the air which was heated by compression. Gasoline engines rely on ignition of air and fuel compressed together as a mixture, which is ignited near the end of the compression stroke using electrically activated spark plugs. Therefore, high compressibility of the fuel matters mainly for gasoline engines. Use of gasoline with lower octane numbers may lead to the problem of engine knocking.</p>

<h5>Proximate analysis of coal</h5>
<P>Proximate analysis is one of the first analyses performed on coal after mining. The test involves heating the coal under various conditions for variable amounts of time to determine moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash yield.</p>

<H5>Low-density polyethylene (LDPE)</h5>


 <br>
    <img src="/static/images/ec/unit4/5.jpg" width = '340px'>
    <br>

<P>Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is a thermoplastic made from the monomer ethylene. 
LDPE has more branching (on about 2% of the carbon atoms) than HDPE, so its intermolecular forces (instantaneous-dipole induced-dipole attraction) are weaker, its tensile strength is lower, and its resilience is higher. Also, because its molecules are less tightly packed and less crystalline due to the side branches, its density is lower.
When exposed to ambient solar radiation the plastic produces two greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene. Due to its low density properties (branching) it breaks down more easily over time, leading to higher surface areas.
LDPE is widely used for manufacturing various containers, dispensing bottles, wash bottles, tubing, plastic parts for computer components, and various molded laboratory equipment. Its most common use is in plastic bags. Other products made from it include:<br>
Trays and general purpose containers<br>
Corrosion-resistant work surfaces<br>
Parts that need to be weldable and machinable<br>
Parts that require flexibility, for which it serves very well<br>
Very soft and pliable parts such as snap-on lids<br>
Six pack rings<br>
Juice and milk cartons are made of liquid packaging board, a laminate of paperboard and LDPE (as the waterproof inner and outer layer), and often with of a layer of aluminum foil (thus becoming aseptic packaging).<br>
Packaging for computer hardware, such as hard disk drives, screen cards, and optical disc drives<br>
Playground slides<br>
Plastic wraps</p>



<H5>High-density polyethylene (HDPE)</h5>

 <br>
    <img src="/static/images/ec/unit4/6.jpg" width = '340px'>
    <br>

<P>High-density polyethylene (HDPE) or polyethylene high-density (PEHD) is a thermoplastic polymer produced from the monomer ethylene. It is sometimes called "alkathene" or "polythene" when used for HDPE pipes.With a high strength-to-density ratio, HDPE is used in the production of plastic bottles, corrosion-resistant piping, geomembranes and plastic lumber. HDPE is commonly recycled.<br>
HDPE has a wide variety of applications; for applications that fall within the properties of other polymers, the choice to use HDPE is usually economic:<br>
